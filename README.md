This comprehensive course, complete with engaging Assignments and Quizzes, delves into the core principles of handling asynchronous data streams.

Reactive Programming, a pivotal development paradigm, revolves around the adept management of asynchronous data streams. Focused on observing and reacting to dynamic changes, this approach ensures the efficient propagation of data. By mastering Reactive Programming, you acquire the essential skills to construct Reactive Systems—be it highly resilient distributed systems or Microservices.

In the realm of modern applications, scalability is crucial. Unfortunately, many applications grapple with time-consuming and blocking IO operations, leading to resource wastage. Embrace the power of reactive programming to author code that is not only highly resilient and reusable but also follows an asynchronous, non-blocking, and declarative style. This strategic approach empowers you to achieve more with fewer system resources.

This course serves as a pivotal foundation for those aiming to specialize in:

- Spring WebFlux
- Reactive Microservices
- Kafka or Redis stream processing

Upon completing this course, you will confidently navigate:

- Grasping the intricacies of Reactive Programming Concepts
- Conducting Asynchronous & Non-blocking operations
- Understanding Mono/Flux Publishers
- Managing Backpressure through various strategies
- Exploring Various Flux operators
- Utilizing Threading & Schedulers
- Working with Sinks - Unicast, Multicast, Replay
- Understanding Hot & Cold Publishers
- Combining multiple publishers with concat, merge, zip, combineLatest, etc.
- Employing Batching techniques with Buffer, Window, GroupBy
- Learning about Repeat & Retry mechanisms
- Conducting Unit Testing with Step Verifier
- Implementing Contexts
- Writing business logic in a declarative style
- Ensuring code resiliency
- Enhancing Error Handling
- Exploring Reactor Hooks / Callbacks
- Mastering Parallel Stream Processing

Whether you are engaged in Spring WebFlux or aspiring to create highly resilient and efficient systems, this course is indispensable for anyone striving to excel in the realm of Reactive Programming.
